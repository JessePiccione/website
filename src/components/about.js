                <h2>Origins of an Engineer</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    I never expected to dive deeply into software engineering, in-fact, before high school
                    I was set on exploring a career unrelated to computers. Everything changed during my
                    junior year when I enrolled into a regular computer programming course. At this time,
                    I figured I would learn the basics of coding, earn a good grade and leave it at that.
                    However, within a month of experimenting with Java, debugging small programs, and
                    building simple applications, something had clicked. It turned out the I had an innate
                    knack for solving programming challenges, and I found the process of writing and refining
                    code from point A to point B genuinely thrilling.
                    <br/>
                    About a month into the course, my teacher noticed the enthusiasm and efficiency with which
                    I tackled each project. He ended up recommending that I switch into the more advanced AP
                    Computer Science course, convinced I could earn a perfect score. Their confidence in my
                    abilities was inspiring. I took to the challenge, poured myself into studying and writing
                    code, and ultimately achieved a perfect score. But, the most important moment came when my
                    teacher asked me a life-changing question:
                    <br/>
                    &qout;What do you want to do for the rest of your life?&qout;
                    <br/>
                    Unsure of my future plans, I mentioned  becoming an actuary. It seemed like the logical
                    choice given my strong math background, but my teacher, Mr. Gattuso, saw a different
                    path. He pointed out that I was not just only good at math; I thrived on dissecting
                    complex problems, writing real-time solutions, and debugging intricate pieces of code.
                    In their words, I genuinely lit up when discussing projects or working through logical
                    puzzles. It was more than a simple hobby or school assignment-- I was truly passionate
                    about every aspect of programming and software development. That moment of encouragement
                    proved to be the turning point that would decide my career path. My teacher healped me
                    see that excitement, creativity, and problem-solving integral to software engineering was
                    exactly what I needed in a future career.
                    <br/>
                    Without that conversation-- without someone believing in my ability to excel in tech-- I
                    might have never pursued this field. Instead, I dove headfirst into building applications,
                    learning new programming languages, and exploring every single new opportunity to grow as
                    developer.
                    <br/>
                    I owe a debt of gratitude to my teacher, who saw something in me that I hadn&apos;t yet recognized
                    in myself. Their guidance and support not only shaped my educational path but also helped me
                    discover a lifelong passion I have for coding. Thank you, Gat, for sparking the drive the
                    drive that led me to become a software engineer, and for steering me towards a world where
                    constant innovation, collaboration, and learning keep me excited every single day.
